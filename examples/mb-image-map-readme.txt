Hi! The only relevant files are:

- Those in /css/milkbox/
- Those in /js/

The others are only there for demo purposes.
You can use milkbox.js instead of milkbox-yc.js

WARNING: xml is loaded with an ajax request, so any local test won't work. You must test on-line. 

If you're an experienced mootooler, you can also cicle the area elements via the $$ function.
