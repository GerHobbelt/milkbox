Hi! The only relevant files are:

- Those in /css/milkbox/
- Those in /js/

The others are only there for demo purposes.
You can use milkbox.js instead of milkbox-yc.js

WARNING: xml is loaded with an ajax request, so any local test won't work. You must test on-line.
WARNING: the flash files are cs5 files. And they could not work locally due to security restrictions.

TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS, PLEASE DO ALL YOUR TESTS ON-LINE.
